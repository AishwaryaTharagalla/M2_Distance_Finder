 ## Abstract
 
 The rearview camera in the car helps us to see the area behind the car when we are backing up.it often provides more visibility behind the car than the view we get by turning our head.but often some cars does not have rearview camera and even some of the rearview cameras stops working due to the accidents, enviromental and different landscape of the india. The rearview cameras may not be affordable for everyone to replace it quite often. In this case the distance finder helps the driver to know the distance between the car and the object. The distance finder calcultes the distance using the ultrasonic sensor and displays it on the lcd which is placed near the driver. to avoid more accidents two or three ultrasonic sensors can be used.
 
An ultrasonic sensor that is able to measure the distance from the ground of selected points of a motor vehicle. The sensor is based on the measurement of the time of flight of an ultrasonic pulse, which is reflected by the ground. A constrained optimization technique is employed to obtain reflected pulses that are easily detectable by means of a threshold comparator. Such a technique, which takes thefrequency response of the ultrasonic transducers into account,allows a sub-wavelength detection to be obtained. Experimentaltests, performed with a 40 kHz piezoelectric-transducer basedsensor, showed a standard uncertainty of 1 mm at rest or at lowspeeds; the sensor still works at speeds of up to 30 m/s, althoughat higher uncertainty. The sensor is composed of only low costcomponents, thus being apt for first car equipment in many cases,and is able to self-adapt to different conditions in order to give thebest results.
