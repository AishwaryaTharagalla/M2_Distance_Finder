 ## Abstract
 
 The rearview camera in the car helps us to see the area behind the car when we are backing up.it often provides more visibility behind the car than the view we get by turning our head.but often some cars does not have rearview camera and even some of the rearview cameras stops working due to the accidents, enviromental and different landscape of the india. The rearview cameras may not be affordable for everyone to replace it quite often. In this case the distance finder helps the driver to know the distance between the car and the object. The distance finder calcultes the distance using the ultrasonic sensor and displays it on the lcd which is placed near the driver. to avoid more accidents two or three ultrasonic sensors can be used.
